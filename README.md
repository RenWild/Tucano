Tucano Chess Engine ![alt text](image/tucano.bmp "Tucano")

This is my chess engine called Tucano. Tucano, or toucan in english, is the name of a colorful bird with an oversized bill, and is popular in my country Brazil. 
I'm an IT professional with passion for chess and programming, so I combined both with the development of the development of a chess engine. 
I've been working on this project for several years and I believe it is now in a stable state where I can release the engine and the source code under General Public License. 
I used the information available on the internet, specially, many other engines source code, such as fruit, crafty, stockfish, rodent, olithink, sungorus, tscp, etc. Thanks to all developers that made this knowledge available.
The main source of information for development of chess engines can is the Chess Programming Wiki Pages (http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/).
In case of any question please send me an email (alcides_schulz@hotmail.com) or stop by talkchess.com.
